# Real-Time-Face-detection-using-opencv
Welcome to the Real-Time Face Detection project! This repository contains a simple yet effective implementation of face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier. This project demonstrates how to capture video from a webcam, convert it to grayscale, and detect faces in real-time, drawing rectangles around the detected faces.
