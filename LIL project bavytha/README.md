Face Detection

Hey people this project is all about face detection. I have done this face detection using Opencv which is a python library module for face detection.
I have also used haarcascade algorithm for face detection. In simple this project is a basic one in face detection.

You can try face detection in opencv or you can go up with any other face detection algorithms such as MTCNN, Fast CNN, R-CNN and even also YOLOv5, YOLOv8.....etc.
This Project is done for Code Clause Internship
